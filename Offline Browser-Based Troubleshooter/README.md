## Offline Browser-Based Troubleshooter
This project has been prepared for entering in the MLH Month-Long-Hackathon.
Protections are necessary to prevent potentially confidential information from being made public; the efforts include the use of generic labels (such as option 1, option 2, error 1, error 2, solution 1, solution 2, etc.) which will be replaced by more appropriate labels during deployment, and the actual solutions will be replaced with placeholder pages.

## Version
This project is similar to one that was designed during a prior hack-week. This one is unrelated to the prior one, will not be written in python, and will be intended for use offline as a browser app.
