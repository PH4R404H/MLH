## Offline Browser-Based Troubleshooter
This project has been prepared for entering in the MLH Month-Long-Hackathon.
Protections are necessary to prevent potentially confidential information from being made public; the efforts include the use of generic labels (such as option 1, option 2, error 1, error 2, solution 1, solution 2, etc.) which will be replaced by more appropriate labels during deployment, and the actual solutions will be replaced with placeholder pages.

Regarding deployment for personal use: The various options and errors should be replaced with those more suitable for the case in question. The MLH logo is used as a placeholder for all logos and images, and should also be replaced as needed. Files could be added and removed as needed, and it is recommended that code/text also be altered as deemed necessary.

## Version
This project is similar to one that was designed during a prior hack-week. This particular project is unrelated to the prior one, will not be written in python, and will be intended for use offline as a browser app.

This project is written in HTTP, CSS, and JS.
